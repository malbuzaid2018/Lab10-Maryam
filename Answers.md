# 1. Written part: Discuss the differences among the results. Does the starting point make a difference?

The breadth first and closest first iterations have the same results.

The depth first printed results in reverse order from the breadth first and closest first iterations starting from China. There is a variation starting from Vietnam because Vietnam also shares a border with Laos.

The random walk iterator stepped through and printed out the countries randomly. It printed in an infinite loop until I added a parameter for a max number of steps. When I used Vietnam as a starting point, it always printed China or Laos first which are the countries it shares a border with. China, which shares a border with all the countries I used was printed multiple times as during the loop.

# 2. Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors.

Referenced from wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem) -  "For maps in which more than one country may have multiple disconnected regions, six or more colors might be required." 

An example of this would be San Marino (fun fact: I have a passport stamp from here!) which is completely surrounded by Italy. Another example is Ll√≠via, an enclave of Spain, which is surrounded by France.
